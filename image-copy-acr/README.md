# image-copy-acr — Infrastructure

Terraform module that deploys the `image-copy-acr` service to Azure Container Apps. The service subscribes to Chainguard registry push events and automatically copies new images into an Azure Container Registry (ACR).

If you supply `existing_acr_name` (and `existing_acr_resource_group`), Terraform will reuse that registry — no new ACR is created. Leave both variables unset and Terraform creates a fresh Basic-tier ACR in the generated resource group. Either way, the rest of the deployment (Container App, managed identity, Chainguard identity and subscription) is identical.

## How it works

```
Chainguard Registry
       │  image pushed
       ▼
Chainguard Subscription ──► Container App (ca-cgr-replicator)  [HTTPS]
                                    │  copies image
                                    ▼
                             Azure Container Registry
```

1. Chainguard sends a CloudEvent (HTTPS POST) to the Container App's public HTTPS endpoint whenever an image is pushed to any repository in your group.
2. The app authenticates to `cgr.dev` using a Chainguard token exchanged via Azure AD workload identity.
3. The app copies the image to the target ACR using its managed identity for authentication.

## Resources created

### Azure

| Resource | Name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Resource Group | `rg-cgr-imagereplication-<random>` | All resources below are placed here unless noted |
| Container Registry | `acrcgr<random>` | Created only when no existing ACR is supplied |
| User-Assigned Managed Identity | `mi-cgr-acr-pushpull` | Used by the Container App to pull/push ACR images |
| Role Assignment | `AcrPull` | Scoped to the resource group that contains the ACR |
| Role Assignment | `AcrPush` | Scoped to the resource group that contains the ACR |
| Container App Environment | `ace-cgr-replicator` | Consumption (serverless) plan |
| Container App | `ca-cgr-replicator` | Runs the Docker-built replicator image |

### Chainguard

| Resource | Description |
|---|---|
| `chainguard_identity` | Workload identity bound to the managed identity via Azure AD claim matching |
| `chainguard_rolebinding` | Grants the identity `registry.pull` on the target group |
| `chainguard_subscription` | Sends push events to the Container App's public URL |

## Prerequisites

### Tools

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) >= 1.3
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) — authenticated with `az login`
- [Chainguard CLI (`chainctl`)](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-enforce/how-to-install-chainctl/) — authenticated with `chainctl auth login`
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) — Terraform builds and pushes the container image via `docker` during `apply`

### Azure permissions

The identity running Terraform needs:

- **Contributor** (or equivalent) on the subscription or resource group to create resources
- **User Access Administrator** on the ACR's resource group to assign AcrPull/AcrPush roles

### Chainguard permissions

The identity running Terraform needs **Owner** or **Editor** on the target Chainguard group to create identities, role bindings, and subscriptions.

## Deployment steps

### 1. Authenticate

```sh
az login
chainctl auth login
```

### 2. Copy and edit the variables file

```sh
cp iac/terraform.tfvars.example iac/terraform.tfvars
```

Edit `terraform.tfvars` and set at minimum:

```hcl
chainguard_org = "your.org.com"   # your Chainguard organization name
```

To use an existing ACR instead of creating a new one, also set:

```hcl
existing_acr_name           = "myregistry"
existing_acr_resource_group = "my-platform-rg"
```

### 3. Authenticate Docker to the ACR

Terraform builds and pushes the container image using Docker during `terraform apply`. The `docker` CLI must be authenticated to the ACR before running `terraform apply`.

**New ACR (Terraform will create it):** Run this _after_ step 4's `init`, but you will need to do a targeted apply first:

```sh
cd iac
terraform apply -target=azurerm_container_registry.new
az acr login --name $(terraform output -raw acr_login_server | cut -d. -f1)
```

**Existing ACR:**

```sh
az acr login --name <existing_acr_name>
```

### 4. Initialize and apply

```sh
cd iac
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Review the plan and confirm. On the first run this takes a few minutes — Docker builds the image and pushes it before the Container App is created.

### 5. Verify

```sh
terraform output webhook_url   # Chainguard subscription sink
terraform output dst_repo      # Where images are copied to
```

You can also check the Container App logs in the Azure Portal or via:

```sh
az containerapp logs show \
  --name ca-cgr-replicator \
  --resource-group $(terraform output -raw resource_group) \
  --follow
```

## Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chainguard_org` | yes | — | Chainguard organization name (e.g. `your.org.com`) |
| `location` | no | `eastus` | Azure region |
| `dst_repo_prefix` | no | `mirrors` | Path prefix in the ACR for copied images |
| `ignore_referrers` | no | `false` | Skip copying signature/attestation tags |
| `verify_signatures` | no | `false` | Verify Chainguard signatures before copying |
| `existing_acr_name` | no | `""` | Name of an existing ACR to use; leave blank to create one |
| `existing_acr_resource_group` | no | `""` | Resource group of the existing ACR; required when `existing_acr_name` is set |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `resource_group` | Name of the generated resource group |
| `acr_login_server` | ACR hostname (e.g. `myregistry.azurecr.io`) |
| `dst_repo` | Full destination repo prefix for copied images |
| `webhook_url` | Public URL of the Container App / Chainguard subscription sink |
| `managed_identity_id` | Resource ID of `mi-cgr-acr-pushpull` |
| `chainguard_identity_id` | Chainguard identity ID used by the Container App |

## Teardown

```sh
cd iac
terraform destroy
```

This removes all resources created by this module, including the Chainguard subscription, identity, and role binding.
